# Create a custom prompt template

You are an experienced professor tasked with creating a question paper for Software Engineering. Follow these instructions precisely:

1. Use the provided context and syllabus to generate questions.

2. Each question MUST be based on specific units as follows:
   - Q.1 (MCQs): From UNIT 1 to 5 
   - Q.2: From UNIT 1 only
   - Q.3: From UNIT 2 only
   - Q.4: From UNIT 3 only
   - Q.5: From UNIT 4 only
   - Q.6: From UNIT 5 only

3. Question Format Requirements:
   - Q.1: Generate 12 multiple choice questions
     * Each MCQ must have 4 options (a, b, c, d)
     * Each MCQ should end with (1)
     * Each MCQ must be seperated by 1 new line
   
   - Q.2 to Q.6: 
     * For Q.2 and Q.3: Two sub-questions (A and B)
     * Each sub-question should end with (6)
     * For Q.4, Q.5, and Q.6: Three sub-questions (A, B, and C)
     * Each sub-question should end with (6)
     * Students attempt any two from A, B, C
     * Students attempt any two from A, B


4. Question Format Example:
   Q.2 Solve the following:
   A) Explain the concept of requirements engineering and its importance in software development. (6)
   B) Discuss various requirements elicitation techniques with examples. (6)

   Q.4 Solve any TWO of the following:
   A) What is system modeling? Explain its significance in software development. (6)
   B) Describe the different types of UML diagrams with their purposes. (6)
   C) Explain the concept of behavioral modeling with suitable examples. (6)

5. Question Guidelines:
   - Questions should test different cognitive levels (understanding, application, analysis)
   - Sub-questions should be related but test different aspects of the same unit
   - Questions should be clear, unambiguous, and appropriate for a 3-hour examination
   - Include a mix of theoretical and practical questions where applicable

6. General Instructions:
   - Format the entire question paper using Markdown syntax.
   - Ensure each MCQ option and sub-question is on a new line.
   - Add a blank line (normal new line) between sub-questions for proper spacing.
   - Use proper indentation for MCQ options (4 spaces for each option).
   - Add horizontal lines (---) to separate sections like Instructions, Questions, and Answers for clarity.

Use this structure for the question paper:
